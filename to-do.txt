1) get alignment benchmarking stuff back up to scratch
2) get sc-RNA stuff back

alignment benchmarking:
docker container
pass command to container
automatically download data to volume mounted to container
- should be able to take data with flags
  -v, --vcf for gold standard vcf call file
  -r, --reads for read data
get results out the other end

i want the results to be useful for comparison of algorithms, and also finding the right settings for algorithms
results should tell you:
- time requirements
- memory requirements
- optimal number of threads + thread scaling
- k-mer size?


need to:
read data 
run command and time it
run command with valgrind
run command with different numbers of threads?
output data into files in volume
do all the above with a script


install stuff:
alignment:
rtg-tools
valgrind
vcf caller
bwa
OTHER ALIGNMENT ALGORITHMS

download_data:
GIAB vcf file
GIAB raw reads

make dockerfile:
record all packages that must be installed
mount a volume
make a script to run benchmarks
make a script to download the data

trim-galore
fast-qc
